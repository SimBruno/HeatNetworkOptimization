# Heat Exchanger Network design


After establishing the minimum energy requirement, the primary objective of heat exchanger network design is to strategically position heat exchangers within the process to attain the heat recovery target. This involves identifying the hot and cold streams for heat exchange, specifying the flow rates on both sides of the heat exchanger, and determining the optimal sizing for each heat exchanger to be integrated into the system.

Your reports should include the following aspects:

## Identification of Penalizing Heat Exchangers

Identify and list the heat exchangers that have the greatest impact on the energy penalty. Conversely, define a list of non-penalizing heat exchangers that require no modification. By removing the streams involved, establish subsets of hot and cold streams for which the heat exchanger network (interconnected heat exchangers) needs to be designed.

## Application of Pinch Design Method

Determine the composite curves and identify the pinch point for each subset. This step also helps define the list of utility streams to be considered for the heat exchanger network design.

Implement the pinch design method to generate a network configuration. With each heat exchanger placement, calculate the heat exchanged, flow rates, temperature conditions, size, and corresponding cost. Utilize loop and path following techniques to attempt the elimination of small heat exchangers. Evaluate the trade-off between cost (changes in the energy bill) and benefits (investment) in this process.
