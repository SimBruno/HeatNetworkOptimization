# Heat Exchanger Network design


After establishing the minimum energy requirement, the primary objective of heat exchanger network design is to strategically position heat exchangers within the process to attain the heat recovery target. This involves identifying the hot and cold streams for heat exchange, specifying the flow rates on both sides of the heat exchanger, and determining the optimal sizing for each heat exchanger to be integrated into the system.

Your reports should include the following aspects:

## Identification of Penalizing Heat Exchangers

<!--Identify and list the heat exchangers that have the greatest impact on the energy penalty. Conversely, define a list of non-penalizing heat exchangers that require no modification. By removing the streams involved, establish subsets of hot and cold streams for which the heat exchanger network (interconnected heat exchangers) needs to be designed.-->
Thanks to the pinch analysis effectuated in the previous section it is possible to identify penalizing heat exchangers.
There are four types of penalizing heat exchangers:

- A cold utility cooling down a hot stream above the pinch

- A hot utility heating up a cold stream below the pinch

- A heat exchanger heating up a cold stream under the pinch using a hot stream above the pinch

- A mixer where the fluids it is mixing are not on the same side of the pinch point, i.e. the cooler fluid intake is below the pinch and the warmer fluid intake is above the pinch


Thanks to having calculated the pinch point at 67.5 °C in the previous section, it is now easy to find the penalizing heat exchangers in each section.

Furthermore, it is possible to calculate the penalty caused by each penalizing heat exchanger, as it is simply the amount of heat utilized by said exchanger.

The Wastewater and sludge production section will be skipped as it does not utilize any heat exchangers.

### Pasteurisation

```{python PastPen, echo = F, eval = F}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from IPython.display import display, HTML

past_pen = {'Exchangers': ['Refrigeration', 'Past1', 'Past2', 'Past3', 'Past4', 'Past5', 'Past6', 'Past7', 'Mixer'],
        'Penalizing': ['Not Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Not Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Not Penalizing'],

df = pd.DataFrame(past_pen)
df = df.set_index('Exchangers')
df = df.round(2)
HTML(df.to_html())
```

### Evaporation

TO BE CORRECTED ONCE THE EVAPORATION SECTION IS CORRECTED

The evaporators are equivalent to mixers.

```{python EvapPen, echo = F, eval = F}

evap_pen = {'Exchangers': ['P1', 'P2', 'P3', 'P4', 'P5', 'Evap1', 'Evap2', 'Evap3'],
        'Penalizing': ['Not Penalizing', 'Not Penalizing', 'Not Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Not Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Not Penalizing'],
        'Penalty (kW)': ['0', '0', '0', '97.89', '0', '3736.00', '3008.00', '0']}
df = pd.DataFrame(evap_pen)
df = df.set_index('Exchangers')
HTML(df.to_html())
```

        'Penalizing': ['Not Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Penalizing', 'Not Penalizing', 'Not Penalizing'],
        'Penalty (kW)': ['0', '67.08', '0.11', '0', '0']}

        'Penalty (kW)': ['175.81', '334.72', '41.84', '41.84', '225.94']}
df = pd.DataFrame(CIP_pen)
df = df.set_index('Exchangers')
HTML(df.to_html())
```

### Rivella Production

R-Mixer1 and R-Mixer2 are ignored because there is no heat exchange occurring in these mixers.

```{python RivPen, echo = F, eval = F}

riv_pen = {'Exchangers': ['Fermentation', 'Evaporator', 'R-HEX1', 'R-Mixer3', 'Green Rivella HEX', 'R-Mixer4', 'Red Rivella HEX'],

dig_pen = {'Exchangers': ['Digestor', 'Steam Dryer'],
        'Penalizing': ['Not Penalizing', 'Penalizing'],
        'Penalty (kW)': ['0', '28.75']}
df = pd.DataFrame(dig_pen)
df = df.set_index('Exchangers')
HTML(df.to_html())
```

## Application of Pinch Design Method

Determine the composite curves and identify the pinch point for each subset. This step also helps define the list of utility streams to be considered for the heat exchanger network design.

Implement the pinch design method to generate a network configuration. With each heat exchanger placement, calculate the heat exchanged, flow rates, temperature conditions, size, and corresponding cost. Utilize loop and path following techniques to attempt the elimination of small heat exchangers. Evaluate the trade-off between cost (changes in the energy bill) and benefits (investment) in this process.
### Heat Exchanger Network Design

To perform the HEN design, one first needs to identify the hot and cold streams. The hot streams are the streams that will be used to heat up the cold streams and vice versa. 
In this design from the results of task 5 and 6, the pinch point is at 67.5 °C for a $\Delta_{min}$ of 10K.
The flows will only be taken from the pasteurization, cleaning in place, hot water and cold storage processes.
However, one constraints is that only penalizing flows will be considered. These are the ones where a cold utility is above the pinch point, a hot utility is below the pinch point or a flows which crosses or starts/ends at the pinch point.
In the HEN design all temperatures are considered in the corrected domain, i.e. $\Delta_{min}/2$ is removed for Hot Flows Temperatures and added for Cold Flows Temperatures.
From the list of the flow determine in task 5, the following flows are penalizing and will be considered for the HEN design:

|  Flow  | Above/Below/Cross Pinch | T_{in} [K] | T_{out} [K] | T*_{in} [K] | T*_{out} [K] | MCp [kW/K] | Q_{flow} [kW] |
|:------:|:-----------------------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|
| A-cold |          Cross          |     333    |     348     |    335.5    |     350.5    |    28.6    |     428.6     |
|  B-hot |          Cross          |     348    |    283.8    |    345.5    |     281.3    |    28.6    |     1834.5    |
| C-cold |        Below ends       |     333    |     338     |    335.5    |     340.5    |     1.6    |      17.5     |
| D-cold |          Cross          |    329.5   |     348     |     332     |     350.5    |     1.9    |      35.6     |
|  E-hot |          Cross          |     348    |     277     |    345.5    |     274.5    |     1.9    |     136.6     |
| F-cold |          Cross          |     333    |     353     |    335.5    |     355.5    |    16.7    |     334.7     |
|  G-hot |          Cross          |     348    |     303     |    345.5    |     300.5    |     5.0    |     225.7     |
|  H-hot |          Cross          |     348    |     333     |    345.5    |     330.5    |    11.7    |     175.5     |

It may be noticed that in the pasteurization process, one didn't consider the flow crossing Past1 HX to heat up from 4°C to 60°C. It has been tried to performed the HEN design with this flow but it introduced a too big unbalanced in the $\sum mcp_{cold}$ vs $\sum mcp_{hot}$ below the pinch (the sum was higher for cold streams instead of hot streams). Thus, this flow has been removed from the HEN design. It is not a problem since this flow, located below the pinch, can be entirely heated up by the part of hot flow B below the pinch. Thus there is no need to cross the pinch point to heat up this flow and it is not penalizing.

Also for the CIP process, the design optimized from task4 with an additionnal HX to heat up the incoming CIP1 flow was used.

Finally, even if the hot flow from the cold storage process is supposed to be penalizing (hot utility below the pinch), it has not been considered in the design due to its extremely low Temperature which makes this hot flow temperatures always below any cold flow temperatures. Thus, it is not possible to create any HX with this kind of flow (recall $T_{hot flow}>T_{cold flow}$).

The two following figures show the flows location on the pasteurization and CIP processes

### Economic Analysis of the Heat Exchanger Network

The economic analysis of the heat exchanger network is done by calculating both the capital cost and the operating cost. The capital cost is calculated by using the following equation (similar to what used in task 4):

$$ \text{INV} = a*F_{BM} \cdot \sum C_{p}\cdot e $$

where 

$$C_{p} = \frac{I_{t}}{I_{ref}}\cdot 10^{k1\cdot k2\cdot log(\text{Area})}$$

$$\text{Area} = \frac{Q_{HX}}{U\cdot LMTD_{HX}}$$ 

where LMTD is taken in the corrected domain ($\Delta T_{min}$ is considered for $T_{cold}$ and $T_{hot}$)

The following values for the capital costs of all the 10 HX used are compiled in the table below:

```{python CapCostHEN, echo = F, eval = F}
dt_A = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5 ]

            LMTD.append(dtmin)
        else:
                LMTD.append((dt_A[i]-dt_B[i])/np.log((dt_A[i]+dtmin)/(dt_B[i]+dtmin)))

The operating cost of the added Cold and Hot Utility is calculated by using the following equation:

$$OP_{Cold Utility} = \frac{Q_{CU}}{COP} \cdot t_{ope} \cdot \text{Cost}_{Electricity}$$
$$OP_{Hot Utility} = \frac{Q_{HU}}{\epsilon} \cdot t_{ope} \cdot \text{Cost}_{NatGas}$$

The table below recaps the operating cost of the added utilities:

```{python OpeCostHEN, echo = F, eval = F}
top = 24*0.95*365 #h/year
gas_fr = 0.08 # €/kWh
elec_fr = 0.12 # €/kWh
COP = 3.5 #same assumption in Energy Bill

In order to assess the economic feasibility of the HEN, the total annualized investment cost and the total operating cost are calculated and compared to the old cost by determining the payback time.

The old cost for the HX involved in this HEN design is: 789.3 k€/yr
Thus the payback time is computed with the following equation:
$$t_{payback} = \frac{INV_{tot,new}}{(a)(OC_{old}-OC_{new})} = 162 \text{years}$$

where $a$ is the annualization factor of 0.08, $OC_{old}$ is the old operating cost and $OC_{new}$ is the new operating cost.

The system is not economically feasible as the payback time is too long. The choice of $\Delta_{min}$ is not optimal are the HEN design cotains some flaws. 
Let's see if we have better results with a different HEN design method.

### Path following methods

### Loop Method

Let's look at two possible loops: 

- a first loop between the flows B and C
- a second loop between the flows E and F

#### Loop 1: between B and C

The loop help us remove the HX E2. 
Thus E6 will be increased by 59.5 kW and E2 will be removed.
