# Introduction {#intro}

In the introduction, consider addressing the following questions relevant to your project:

- What is the background and motivation behind your project? Why do you wish to undertake process integration and optimization for the dairy factory?
- What are the primary challenges and issues you aim to tackle in this study? Is it focused on heat exchanger network design and/or utility integration?
- Is there existing work similar to yours in this domain? If so, what are the contributions and limitations of their research?
- What contributions do you intend to make through your project?
- How have you organized your project report to effectively convey your findings and insights?

You do not need to answer all of these questions explicitly, but ensure that your introduction provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of the problem and its context.
