To a business manager, industrial processes may seem mysterious and complex, like \"black boxes.\" However, as engineers, we need to dig into the details, using mathematics and physics to analyze and design these industrial processes.\n\nIn this section, your task is to compute the thermodynamic properties of all the streams within each section of the dairy factory. The data collected here will be instrumental in calculating exergy efficiency and energy bills in the following section. To facilitate your work, we have provided an illustrative example for the Pasteurization section below:\n\n## Pasteurisation section\n\n![Pasteurisation](Figures/pasteurisation.svg)\n\nIn this section will be presented the mass and energy balances for each chemical operation of the milk pasteurisation. This pasterisation aims to produce cream and and milk from fresh milk with the intergation of a thickener at some point. \n\n### Mass Flows \n\nBecause of the mass flow conservation, we have:\n\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot m_{Mixure~Out} = \\dot m_{Past{\\_}Cent} = \\dot m_{Fresh~Milk} = 8~kg/s \\\\\n\n\\dot m_{Milk{\\_}0} = \\dot m_{Past{\\_}a} = \\dot m_{Past{\\_}b} = \\dot m_{Past{\\_}c} =  \\dot m_{Past{\\_}d} = \\dot m_{Milk} = 7.52~kg/s \\\\\n\n\\dot m_{cream{\\_}0} = \\dot m_{crpast{\\_}a} = \\dot m_{Past{\\_}cent} - \\dot m_{Milk{\\_}0} =  \\dot m_{Fresh~Milk} - \\dot m_{Milk} = 8 - 7.52 = 0.48~kg/s ~~ (centrifuge) \\\\\n\n\\dot m_{crpast{\\_}x} = \\dot m_{crpast{\\_}b} = \\dot m_{crpast{\\_}c} = \\dot m_{Cream} =  0.55~kg/s \\\\\n\n\\dot m_{thickener} = 0.07~kg/s \\\\\n\n\\end{cases}\n\nConsequently, all mass flows are defined.\n\n### Heat Capacity\n\nAre already provided the following heat capacity data:\n\n- $c_{p,Raw~Milk} = 3.8 kJ/(kgK)$ (milk after centrifuge)\n\n- $c_{p,Cream~ac} = 3.4 kJ/(kgK)$ (cream after centrifuge)\n\nFrom Litterature [add reference] we chose:\n\n- $c_{p,thickener} = c_{p,albaline} = 0.07 kJ/(kgK)$\n\nAssuming that the mixer provides an ideal mix, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    c_{p,cream} &= \\frac{\\dot m_{cream{\\_}0}}{\\dot m_{Cream}}.c_{p,Cream~ac} + \\frac{\\dot m_{thickener} }{\\dot m_{Cream}}.c_{p,thickener} \\\\\n    \\\\\n    c_{p,cream} &= \\frac{0.48}{0.55}.3400 + \\frac{0.07}{0.55}.4175 \n\\end{align*}\n\nFinally:\n\n- $c_{p,cream} = 3.5~kJ/(kgK)$\n\n\n\n### Equations of operations \n\n#### Refrigeration\n\n$\\dot Q_{refrigeration} = \\dot m_{Fresh~Milk} . c_{p,Fresh~Milk} . (T_{Fresh~Milk} - T_{Mixure{\\_}out})$\n\n#### PAST1\n\n$\\dot Q_{past~1} = \\dot m_{Fresh~Milk} . c_{p,Fresh~Milk} . (T_{Past{\\_}cent} - T_{Mixure{\\_}out}) = \\dot m_{Milk} . c_{p,Raw~Milk} . (T_{Past{\\_}d} - T_{Past{\\_}c})$\n\n#### TO CONTINUE\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nfrom CoolProp.CoolProp import PropsSI\nrho = PropsSI('D', 'T', 298.15, 'P', 101325, 'Nitrogen')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nfrom pyxosmose.state import State\n# First, define the thermodynamic point,\nPoint1 = State(pair='TP', fluid='Water', temperature=340, pressure=31000)\n# Then calculate the state using the State class method StateCalc\nPoint1.StateCalc()\n# And print the dictionary for revision\nState1 = Point1.__dict__ # Whole dictionary with properties\nh1 = Point1.enthalpy # Point.enthalpy is equivalent to State1[\"enthalpy\"]\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# a way to pass the value from python to r is to through json file\nlibrary(reticulate)\nx = 42\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Evaporation section\n\n\n## Process 3\n\n...\n\n",
