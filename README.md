# Industrial Dairy Factory – Energy & Exergy Optimization (Graduate Research Project)

## Overview
Graduate research project (EPFL, Fall 2023) analyzing and optimizing the **energy and environmental performance** of a dairy processing facility.  
The work combined **thermodynamic modeling, exergy analysis, heat recovery design, pinch analysis, and utility integration** to identify cost-saving and decarbonization opportunities.  

## Core question: 

How can an industrial dairy factory reduce energy costs and exergy losses while integrating circular-economy co-products (e.g., Rivella from whey, biogas from sludge)?

## Methods (pipeline)

### 1) Thermodynamic modeling & process description
- Computed **heat and mass balances** for all major sections: pasteurization, evaporation, drum dryers, Cleaning-in-Place, cold storage, hot water generation, and wastewater/sludge handling.  
- Established flow properties as a basis for exergy and energy analyses.

---

### 2) Energy & exergy analysis
- **Exergy losses** were quantified across subsystems, with pasteurization and evaporation identified as major inefficiencies.  
- An **energy bill** was calculated for both France and Germany, yielding OPEX of **1.43 M€/yr** and **1.68 M€/yr**, respectively.

---

### 3) Heat recovery
- Optimized minimum temperature differences in heat exchangers to improve efficiency.  
- Evaluated additional heat recovery in pasteurization and Cleaning-in-Place processes.  
- Found modest OPEX reductions, with country-specific differences in feasibility.

---

### 4) Pinch analysis & Heat Exchanger Network (HEN) design
- Constructed **hot/cold composite curves** and the **grand composite curve**.  
- Determined minimum energy requirement (**15,873 kW**), maximum recovery potential (**27,013 kW**), and pinch temperature (**67 °C**).  
- Designed HEN using **path and loop methods**:  
  - Path → reduced CAPEX, increased OPEX  
  - Loop → increased CAPEX, reduced OPEX  

---

### 5) Utility integration
- Modeled alternative technology mixes with **Rosmose**: cooling tower, boiler, cogeneration engine, heat pump, and refrigeration.  
- Integrated utilities with the grand composite curve to minimize exergy losses.  
- Identified optimal configuration: **cogeneration engine + HP + refrigeration + cooling tower**, with **no boiler required**.

---

### 6) Co-product valorization (circular economy)
- **Rivella production**: converting whey into a beverage co-product → halved utilities installation costs via increased revenue.  
- **Biogas production**: digestion of whey and sludge → low financial returns, limited impact on costs.  
- Combined Rivella + Digester scenario showed Rivella as the dominant value-adding option.

---

## Results
- Large **exergy losses** in pasteurization and evaporation highlight need for efficiency improvements.  
- **Heat recovery** and **HEN design** yielded moderate OPEX reductions but were sensitive to process configurations.  
- **Utility integration** showed boilers unnecessary; cogeneration and HPs are more effective.  
- **Rivella co-production** strongly reduced TOTEX via new revenue streams, while **biogas** had negligible effect.  
- **Final recommendation:** Collaborate with Rivella and implement optimized energy conversion technologies.
